# go-translate
A command line tool for finding English to French and French to English translations.

## Who says?
I use the Glosbe translation API and the wordreference website to get conjugation/word parellels.

## Use
I put the binary inside `$GOPATH/bin` and created a bash alias `fren` and `enfr`. Pass in the word for translation as a command line argument.
